# Crystal

This is my type-along sort of version of Cherno's Hazel Engine. The vast majority of the code in this repository is basically the same as his with some minor changes when I felt like doing something slightly differently.

Currently this repository is up to date with the following commit: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/tree/ffb53e932e2ddbf3112aca31bef291295ecf4906

Currently this is a basic graphics application with input, event loops, layer system and such. It should be possible even if not particularly pleasurable to make a game with the program as is right now, but some major systems are still missing such as an ECS, scripting, audio.

To clone this repository use:

To build run GenerateProjects.bat which runs a premake-file generating a VS2019 project file.
